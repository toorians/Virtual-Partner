                <p>
                    We want to give our current logo an "uplift", utilizing the
                    same icon and story to go with our logo but giving it a new
                    color to match our website, and potentially new typography
                    and a slightly new look and feel but still recognizable to be
                    our brand. We connect visitors to the islands in unexpected
                    ways that open their eyes to the wonder ofmHawai’i. Our
                    exclusive experiences are delivered with authentic
                    hospitality, and intersect the land, the people and the culture
                    of Hawai’i for adventures that lead to lasting memories and
                    encourage a change in perspective.
